# Advanced Neural Networks Lab – Handwritten Digit Classification with MNIST

This project was completed as part of my **IDIA4** training at **Polytech Nantes**.  
The objective is to experiment with **neural network architectures** for image classification, using the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits.

## Context

The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning, consisting of gray images of handwritten digits (0–9).  
This lab aims to compare two popular neural network architectures:

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: a basic feedforward network  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: a more advanced architecture leveraging spatial hierarchies in image data

## Objectives

- Understand and implement a basic MLP  
- Improve performance using a CNN architecture  
- Analyze training curves and evaluate model performance  
- Gain hands-on experience with PyTorch for model building and training

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebook
